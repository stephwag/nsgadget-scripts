## Super Menu Overload

Desyncs and duplicates weapons to aid in achieving [super menu overload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE9qypTqMOg).

### Setup

- Make sure that:
  - The weapon you intend to duplicate is both equipped and selected.
  - The weapon you intend to desync with is immediately on the left of the equipped weapon.
- Start a "regular" menu overload.

For example, if you want to duplicate Royal Halberds by desyncing them with Royal Guard Halberds, this is what your screen should look like before running the script.

With the game still paused, plug in the Teensy with this script. It will now desync and duplicate weapons indefinitely.
